sysinfo
=======

My Linux sysinfo utility.

Just uncompress and run make.

And enjoy!

Have fun with this little program.

I have ported this program to C++ and fixed many bugs. This program 
tested with gcc 4.3.2. You can see the /proc/version information and 
more about your kernel and memory/swap information.

And this program is lightning fast!
